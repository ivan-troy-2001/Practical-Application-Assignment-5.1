# Practical Application Assignment 5.1

### Overview:
The goal of this project is to use what I have learned about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

### Data:
This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. Answers given that the users will drive there “right away” or “later before the coupon expires” are labeled as “Y = 1”, and answers “no, I do not want the coupon” are labeled as “Y = 0”. There are five different types of coupons—less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out and take away, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).

### Deliverables:
Jupiter notebook.

### Findings:
#### Bar coupon group
- Drivers who go to a bar 3 or fewer times have a higher probability of accepting a bar coupon than those who go more than 3 times.
- Not having kids as passengers while driving increases the probability of accepting a bar coupon.
- Drivers who go to cheap restaurants have a low acceptance rate of bar coupons.

#### Coffee coupon group
- 21 years old group has the highest acceptance rate than any other group.
- Drivers who reported low income are more likely to accepts coffee coupons.
- Students and those who have computer and mathematical occupations are the top groups with highest rate acceptance than other groups.

### Next Steps:
